Welcome to the DFreds Module wiki! I'm Derek (aka DFreds) and I create modules and macros for
FoundryVTT. 

This wiki includes instructions, features, documentation, and other information for all of my premium and free modules.

In order to access the premium modules, be sure to subscribe to the
[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/dfreds) at the appropriate tier. Note that
some modules are released in Early Access before being moved to the Supporter
tier.
