listed below.

## Basic Steps

If you're having an issue, do the following steps before reaching out for help:

1. Ensure the module and its dependencies are up to date.
1. Ensure that your Foundry is up to date with the latest stable version
supported by the module.
1. Check if the issue persists in a Chromium based browser like Chrome or Edge.
    - Non-Chromium based browsers (Firefox, Opera, Safari) can sometimes cause issues.
1. Disable all other modules and see if the issue persists.
    - Sometimes, issues can arise from conflicts with other mods. Use tools like
    [Find the Culprit](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/find-the-culprit/) to
    narrow down the modules to the problematic one.
1. Check the [wiki page](tags/module) for the module, which may contain
information on how to resolve common issues.
1. Search the
[#troubleshooting-help](https://discord.com/channels/1200171647022403664/1328402271372840990)
board for a similar issue to see if it's been solved.
1. Search the [Discord](https://discord.gg/Wq8AEV9bWb) for a similar issue to see if it's been solved.
1. If it's a free module, check if there is an open issue on the corresponding
[GitHub](https://github.com/topics/dfreds-modules) page.

## Filing a Bug Report
