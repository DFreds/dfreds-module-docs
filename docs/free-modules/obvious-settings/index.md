# DFreds Obvious Settings

A FoundryVTT module that makes the settings configuration more obvious in various ways.

## Let Me Sell You This

When setting up your new game, isn't it a bit confusing which settings will
impact players, and which settings will only impact yourself? Do you forget what
settings are different from their default values? Well, if only there was a
module to help you out...

## What This Module Does

This module adds a ðŸŒŽ icon before settings scoped to "world" (will be set for
all players) and a ðŸ‘¤ icon before settings scoped to "client" (personal settings
per user).

It also indicates if a setting is not set to its default value.
