A module that adds easy to use toggleable active effects for common use cases.

Currently, the DND5e and SW5e systems have pre-created effects, but any system
can create their own effects.

## Let Me Sell You This

Do you struggle to remember what all those conditions and spells actually do to
players and NPCs? Or how they interact? Consider this. Your player just rolled,
but you forgot that they were invisible and should have rolled with advantage.
But wait a minute, the enemy is also invisible! So now it cancels out. "Oh
drats," you think to yourself to further prove this crazy point, "the player
also has Bless cast on them! Has that expired yet??"

Sure, you could figure all that out... if you wanna be lame. Or you could be
cool and just use this module.

## What This Module Does

This module helps with the types of issues described above by allowing creation
of active effects that can be applied quickly and easily. For DND5e and SW5e, it
provides dozens of pre-configured effects for conditions and spells.

You can configure some stuff:
