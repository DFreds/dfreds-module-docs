A FoundryVTT module that allows configuring and editing of the status effects.

## Overview

Status Effects enhances Foundry VTT's token status management by providing
complete control over the status effects that appear on the token HUD. This
module empowers Game Masters to customize their status effect options beyond the
default set, allowing for a more tailored gaming experience.

The module introduces an intuitive configuration interface where users can
create, edit, and organize status effects with ease. Through a simple
drag-and-drop interface, you can reorder status effects to match your preferred
layout, ensuring quick access to the most frequently used statuses during
gameplay.

Whether you need to create custom status effects for unique game mechanics,
modify existing ones to better match your campaign's needs, or simply reorganize
the presentation of status options, Status Effects provides the tools necessary
to streamline your token status management workflow.
