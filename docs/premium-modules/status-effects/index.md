A FoundryVTT module that allows configuring and editing of the status effects.

## Features

- Adds a new button to the token config for new status effects
- Provides a simple to use config sheet to drag/drop or create new status effects
- Optionally allows hiding the default status effects HUD button

## Let Me Sell You This

Wouldn't it be cool if you could manipulate the status effects that appear on
the token HUD? Maybe you could delete them, edit them, or even create your own.
Well, now you can.

## What This Module Does

This module provides an easy-to-use configuration menu to add, edit, or update
any status effects and have them appear on the token HUD. You can also control
the order in the list by dragging and dropping.

You can configure some stuff:

And then view them on the token HUD:
