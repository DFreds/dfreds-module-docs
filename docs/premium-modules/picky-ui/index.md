A FoundryVTT module that allows you to hide aspects of the UI of your game.

## Overview

Picky UI gives you control over which UI elements appear in your game. Through a
simple config menu, you can toggle individual scene controls and entire sections
on or off. When all tools in a section are disabled, that section automatically
disappears, helping maintain a clean and focused interface that displays only
the elements you need.
