Hey everyone!

I'm announcing a new premium module: **DFreds Clipboard**.

It will be available for the Early Access tier for at least the next month, before moving to the Supporter tier.

You can download it straight from Foundry, but the Foundry page is [here](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/dfreds-clipboard)!

For more info on it, check out the [wiki page](https://www.dfreds-modules.com/premium-modules/clipboard/)!
