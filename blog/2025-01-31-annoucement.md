Hey all, I wanted to give an update on changes regarding my modules. 

First, some context. At the start of January, I was affected by a layoff and am
currently unemployed. While I'm looking for a new role, it's a slow process and
it's not quite clear how long it will take to land back on my feet. 

I've always released and maintained my modules completely for free, with the
idea that anyone could opt to donate if they chose with minimal rewards (some
Discord benefits and some personal help). The reason I did it this way was
because this has always been something I've done for fun, and it's offered some
interesting challenges and allowed me to interact with the Foundry community.
However, I can no longer justify the large amount of hours I pour into Foundry
dev, and I want to see if I can turn it into something real.

As such, I will be releasing some premium, paid modules in the next couple of
weeks through this Patreon. 

Currently, the Patreon has 3 tiers: 

- Supporter ($7/month)
- Early Access ($10/month)
- Ultimate ($20/month)

For the next month, I'm going to offer the Early Access tier for $8 a month.
This is where all new premium modules start while they are being developed
before moving over to the Supporter tier. It's a way to drive development and
help test out new modules. If you opt into this tier at $8 in the next month, it
will always be $8 for you. 

To clarify a few more important things: 

All existing modules will continue to be maintained and updated free of charge.
This also doesn't mean that every new module I make will be a premium one.

If you are a Supporter on Patreon already, nothing changes for you. You can
access the premium modules as a thanks for your previous support.

Thanks all. Let me know if you have any questions over in ‚Å†general, and stay
tuned for news of the premium modules!
