Hey all!

I'm happy to announce my newest module and first premium module: **DFreds Status
Effects**.

It will be available for the Early Access tier for at least the next month,
before moving to the Supporter tier.

You can download it straight from Foundry, but the Foundry page is [here](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/dfreds-status-effects)!

For more info on it, check out the [wiki page](https://www.dfreds-modules.com/premium-modules/status-effects/)!
