First off, I'd just like to say thanks for being here! I'm Derek and I like
coding, gaming, and playing DnD. But honestly that's enough about me.

I started this Patreon because FoundryVTT has been a fantastic experience for me
from a DM, player, and developer perspective. I'm excited that I'm able to share
what I can with the larger community and I hope that you enjoy my current (and
future) modules!
