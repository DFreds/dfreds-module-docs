Hey everyone!

I'm announcing a new premium modules: **DFreds AI Helper**.

It will be available in Early Access for the next couple of months while I bake
in more features. This one can truly be considered Early Access, so expect
potential bugs and some minor UI or formatting issues. I also expect it to grow
and change as I get feature requests and ideas. You can find it
[in the shop](https://www.patreon.com/dfreds/shop/dfreds-ai-helper-v1-0-0-1085429?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&utm_source=copyLink&utm_campaign=productshare_creator&utm_content=join_link)!
