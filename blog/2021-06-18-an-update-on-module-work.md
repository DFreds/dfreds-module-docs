Hello to those who want to read!

I've done a lot of work over the past week and figured I'd give a quick info
dump about what's been changing.

**DFreds Convenient Effects**

Over the past week, my convenient effects module has seen 6 new updates that add
new effects, features, and close some bugs. You can head over to the
[releases](https://github.com/DFreds/dfreds-convenient-effects/releases) page to
check out the specifics, but here are some highlights:

<!-- truncate -->

- Macro support
- Effects can be applied to targets
- Chat messages when effects are applied, removed, or expired
- Dialogs when a spell or effect has multiple sub-effects to choose from (like
Enhance Ability)
- Integration with Active Token Lighting module

I also added a bunch new effects, including:

- Feeblemind
- Heroism
- Light
- Sacred Weapon
- Turn Undead
- Greater Invisibility
- Invisibility (Spell)
- Persistent Rage
- Holy Aura
- Vicious Mockery
- Contagion
- Half cover
- Three-quarters cover

You can expect integrations with modules such as with token magic in the future.
I'm also considering adding a bunch of passive effects to the module, but I'm
unsure how I want to do that yet. 

**DFreds Droppables**

This module has really been seeing a lot of traffic lately with installs up to
over 20% (!!) on the Forge. Best of all, no bug reports! 

I'm unsure if this module should be expanded or where to expand it. I originally
called it 'Droppables' because I assume I would find other places that need this
kind of drop helpers, but nothing has come to mind so far. If you think of
anything, send me a message.

**DFreds Pocket Change**

I haven't been working on Pocket Change for a bit. I think it's in a great place
and does what it is meant to do, and while I have ideas to improve or add
features, I'm trying to avoid going outside of its scope.

Future Modules

I have a cool, new module in development, but it isn't ready for primetime quite
yet. Stay tuned and hopefully it will be announced soon!

Let me know if you have any thoughts or suggestions!
